# DataManing tasks -> Market basket analysis - Associacion Rules + Clustering 

I would like to present my final projects on Data Mining labs. 

1. Market basket analysis - Assocication rules - I answer the question : Which products should be close to each other (on the retail space) and thus how to increase sale of it?

2. Clustering Project - I answer th question: Is it possible to grouped pokemon by types (water, fire ect.) based only on basic stats (HP, Sepc. Attack ect)?

Enjoy discovering my project! I hope you find it usefull and interesting :)
