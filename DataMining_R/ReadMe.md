# Data Mining Projects -> Market basket analysis - Associacion Rules and Clustering.

1. Market basket analysis - Assocication rules - I answer the question : Which products should be situated close to each other (on the retail space) and thus how to increase sales?

2. Clustering Project - I answer the question: Is it possible to group pokemon by types (water, fire ect.) based only on basic stats (HP, Spec. Attack ect.)?

Don't hesitate to download the html file to view projects in a more comfortable way.

Enjoy discovering my project! I hope you will find it usefull and interesting :)
